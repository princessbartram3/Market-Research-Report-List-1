<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gear Differential</li><li>Anti-Slip Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The **Commercial Vehicle Differential Market** includes two primary types: **Gear Differential** and **Anti-Slip Differential**. Gear Differentials are standard systems that distribute torque between wheels, enabling smooth turns by allowing wheels to rotate at different speeds. Anti-Slip Differentials, on the other hand, enhance traction by limiting wheel slip, especially in challenging conditions like off-road or slippery surfaces. Both types are crucial for vehicle performance, with Gear Differentials focusing on balance and Anti-Slip Differentials prioritizing stability and control.</p></p>
