<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber-optic sensors market is divided into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic sensors. Intrinsic fiber-optic sensors utilize the fiber itself as the sensing element, measuring changes in parameters like temperature or pressure along the fiber's length. In contrast, extrinsic fiber-optic sensors have an external sensing element that interacts with the fiber, relying on changes detected at the sensor interface, often for applications requiring more complex measurements. Both types offer high sensitivity and immunity to electromagnetic interference.</p></p>
