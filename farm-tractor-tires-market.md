<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Farm Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The farm tractor tires market is primarily divided into bias-ply and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires are constructed with overlapping rubber plies at an angle, offering durability and affordability, making them suitable for lighter tasks and uneven terrains. Radial-ply tires feature plies perpendicular to the tread, providing better fuel efficiency, traction, and reduced soil compaction, ideal for heavy-duty farming. While bias-ply tires are cost-effective, radial-ply tires are preferred for modern, high-performance tractors due to their enhanced performance and longevity.</p></p>
